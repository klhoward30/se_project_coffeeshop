#mTriple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would improve the project by changing the color scheme. I more so like the color scheme on the "Menu" page versus the darker colors on the "Recipes" and "About the Coffee Shop" pages. I would also improve it by adding different images, particularly on the first page of the site.
